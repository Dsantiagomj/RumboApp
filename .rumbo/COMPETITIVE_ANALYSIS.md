## 🏁 Competitive Strategy

### Phase 1: Colombian Niche (v1-v3)

- **Target:** Colombians with financial stress
- **Advantage:** Only tool built FOR them
- **Moat:** Colombian context + grocery intelligence

### Phase 2: Latin America (v4-v5)

- **Target:** Expand to Mexico, Argentina, Chile
- **Advantage:** Localization + AI
- **Moat:** Network effects (store price data, user patterns)

### Phase 3: Global (v6+)

- **Target:** English-speaking markets
- **Advantage:** AI-first + grocery optimization
- **Moat:** Data moat (millions of receipts, shopping patterns)

---

**Conclusion:** Rumbo occupies a unique position—no direct competitor has the combination of Colombian focus + AI-first + grocery intelligence + financial planning. The closest competitors (Maybe, YNAB) don't work in Colombia and lack AI/grocery features.
